            This file, vk.xml, is the Vulkan API Registry. It is a critically important
            and normative part of the Vulkan Specification, including a canonical
            machine-readable definition of the API, parameter and member validation
            language incorporated into the Specification and reference pages, and other
            material which is registered by Khronos, such as tags used by extension and
            layer authors. The authoritative public version of vk.xml is maintained in
            the default branch (currently named main) of the Khronos Vulkan GitHub
            project. The authoritative private version is maintained in the default
            branch of the member gitlab server.
